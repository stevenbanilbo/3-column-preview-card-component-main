## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I should've focused on the content inside the boxes/cards first rather than starting from the layout that could've shorten my time in finishing the project.

### Continued development

Flexbox and proper sizing adjustments

### Useful resources

- https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_flexbox_container.asp - This helped me in using flexbox properties properly
